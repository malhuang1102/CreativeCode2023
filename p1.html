        Description

      <p> 
       
       This assignment aims to let us depict, in p5.js, an object that our group parnter recently lost. I teamed up with Chai.
       Chai described the bottle to me as: A blue transparent plastic water bottle with a lid and a white measuring scale engraved as milliliters. It's not insulated so you can feel the temperature of the water on the surface by your hand. It's quite thick but easy to grab, which allows you to easily put in your backpack pocket and bring everywhere and to easily wash.
      </p>

      <p>
        To convey the transparency of the bottle, I experimented with a screen-printing-like process. By combining geometric shapes layer by layer.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img src="Bottle.png" width="400" height="400">
        <img src="Bottle2.png" width="400" height="400">
      </div>

      <p>
       I started out thinking about what simple geometrical shapes I could use to put together the shape of the bottle, as well as the distince highlights on it, which is a crucial part of depicting a transparant bottle realistically. After putting the shapes together, I started experimenting with using different values of blue on each shape to find the most realistic "transparent" effect.Then by layering on darker shade beneath the see-through body, I managed to create a more dynamic highlight that conveys the intense light flection we see on a smooth, plastic bottle.

      <p>
       This is the second time of me trying out p5 js. I remember after hearing the description from my partner Chai, I went on to p5 js tutorial and saw how unintuitive drawing a curve is. That was when I decided to take a more "deceptive", yet intuitive process. I'm quite happy with how the final drawing, with minimal details, still looks somewhat realistic.
