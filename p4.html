        The equisite corpse, a technique invented by surrealists in the 1900s, in which players write in draws on a sheet of paper, fold it to conceal part of the drawing, and then pass it to the next player for a further contribution. This project aims to achieve the same effect, combining parts of a character from three contributor, we generated this unexpected being.

      <p>
        Partnering up with Matthew and Yu, we each designed our character first. I wanted my character, to fit the bizarre, surrealist, Frankenstein-style theme of Equisite Corspe, to look like an elusive, stern mystical creature. So, I drew inspiration from the Egyptian Deity drawing and a dark color theme and "mixed and matched" elements into this character.

    However, translating this image into code was not a very breezy process. I had to depend on the SVG to p5 converter heavily to convert the irregular curves to p5 code. Althought it's quite useful translating simple bezier curves, it sucks at translating more complex drawings. The results weren't optimal and required adjusting the placement of each elements, also because I wanted to still preserve the flexibity to change the colors of the drawing, so instead of coding my drawing in top, middle, bottom, three parts, I devided the whole drawing into layers of shapes.
